- 👋🏾 Hi, I’m @Soini-S
- 💬 I’m interested in the fields of data analytics, data science and python programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data analytics after enrolling in a course online with Cisco.
- 🔍 I’m a beginner and so I'm mostly browsing people's profiles to gain insight on conventions and understand what Github is used for!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a Bsc. in pharmaceutical sciences and was about to become a licensed pharmacist in the UK before I realised informatics & technology is where my heart lies 💙
